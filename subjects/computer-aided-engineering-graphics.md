# Computer Aided Engineering Graphics

## Unit - I

**Introduction**: Significance of engineering graphics, BIS conventions, drawing sheets, drawing scales, dimensioning, line conventions, material conventions. Symbolic representation of fasteners - bolts and nuts, riveted, welded, brazed and soldered joints, bars and profile sections, electrical & electronic elements and piping. 

**Use of Simple CAD tools**: Overview of CAD software [Menu bar, tabs -sketch, modify, dimension, annotation and commands].

**Orthographic Projections**: Principles of orthographic projections - quadrant systems, projection of points (All quadrants); Projection of lines (first angle projection); Projection of planes - inclined to HP, VP and PP (first angle projection).

## Unit - II

**Projection of Solids**: Prisms, pyramids, cylinder & cone with axis inclined to HP and VP (first angle projection). (Computer Drafting)

## Unit - III

**Isometric projection**: Isometric scale, Isometric Projection of regular solids and combination of two simple solids (Computer Drafting).

**3D modeling of components**: Conversion of isometric view to orthographic views and sectional views, missing views in orthographic projections. (Computer Drafting)

## Unit - IV

**Development of lateral surfaces**: Introduction to section planes, methods of development - parallel line method and radial line method â€“ prism and cylinder (truncated), pyramid and cone (frustum and truncated) and transition pieces (Computer Drafting).

## Unit - V
